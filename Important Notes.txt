//Running from command line
mstest /testcontainer:Crap4NetTests.dll

//Show the duration of the tests (good for putting some constarins on specific tests. make sure that performance has not been damaged by more than X%)
mstest /testcontainer:Crap4NetTests.dll /detail:duration

//running with specific configuration
mstest /runconfig:..\..\..\LocalTestRun.testrunconfig /testcontainer:Crap4NetTests.dll


//Running refelctor Metrics from command line:

IMPORTANT - 
	1) need to have setup the metric plugin
	2) the gui will open and auto close when finished.
	3) must have permission to write the output file - or you get a cryptic exception!!!
	
"C:\Users\Lior\AppData\Roaming\Mutant Design\TestDriven.NET 2.0\Reflector\Reflector.exe" /Run:Reflector.CodeMetrics /Assembly:"DummyProject.dll" /OutputPath:"ReflectorReport.xml"


RUNNING PART COVER
1) use corflags toforce partcover to run 32 bit mode!!!!
2) if running with mstest must need noisolation flag otherise no actual data is collected.
3) best course of action is to use the supplied PartCover.config file as followed:
(from the folder with the dummytest project)
	"c:\Program Files (x86)\Gubka Bob\PartCover .NET 2.3\partcover" --settings ..\..\PartCover.config
	
4) and there is a GUI fopr reveiwing results and running them....
